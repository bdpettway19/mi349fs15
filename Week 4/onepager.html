    <h1>One Pager</h1>
    <h3> Short pitch </h3>
    <div class="short"><p>A website that brands who Barry Pettway is with the use of multi- media.</p></div>
    <h3> Long pitch </h3>
    <div class="long"><p>This website will feature background information, the plethora of life experiences I’ve gained from my travels; whether that’s by showing images, journal entries and even music. But this site will not only serve as a visual autobiography, it’ll also display my skill set and attributes that I have for future employers to review. With the use of galleries, message threads, and other media spectrums, users will have an in depth clarification on who Barry Pettway is and will have the opportunity to pot opinions and ask questions about different aspects of my life.</p></div>
