                <p>   Hello viewers, my name is Barry Dennard Pettway. I'm a detroit native and I was raised on the east and westside of the city. I have 3 siblings, whom are all girls and I'm the youngest. I graduated school and decided to attend Michigan State University. This decision was prompted because of their top notch study abroad program. Throughout my time I've participated in several programs, which have been life changing.
                </p>

                <p> Growing up I was very active in sports and art. In grade school I had several artistic acomplishments; Artist of the Month, art exhibitions, as well as other artistic awards. I played basketball, baseball, and ran cross country. During my travels, I've been able to put my athleticism to use during various pursuits such as hiking, climbing and biking.
